    <h3 class="mrshirt1b">About Me and the Website : </h3>
    <details class="mrshirt2b">
     <summary class="mrshirt2a">Who am I?</summary>
    <br>
    Good Day (or Night) I'm someone who goes by the name <q>Trinkets</q>, I'm a novice in Front End Web Development, So don't expect me to create "The Next Facebook and stuff" just yet.
    </details>
    <details class="mrshirt2b">
     <summary class="mrshirt2a">What is this Website all about?</summary>
     <br>
     This Website is a service that takes you, the Client, Commissions for a Website of any kind (i.e : from Advertisements to Blogsites, etc, etc)
     <br><br>
     Do note that I'm not taking any Commisions at the moment due to the lack of 'equipment'

     What to Expect when you commission for a Website :
    </h3>
    <details class="mrshirt2b">
    <summary class="mrshirt2a">A Fairly Simple Website like this one</summary>
     <br>
     Just a simple Website created by a novice like me, nothing fancy.
    </details>
    <details class="mrshirt2b">
    <summary class="mrshirt2a">Created Fairly Fast</summary>
     <br>
     Less Work means Less Time needed per project, which means you'll just need to wait around 1-7 days before you get a Website that I'll consider as a <em>Finished Product</em>
    </details>
    <details class="mrshirt2b">
    <summary class="mrshirt2a">Probably Cost</summary>
     <br>
     I have very small fees so you can probably save tons of cash if you commisioned to me instead (Just Don't)
    </details>
    <details class="mrshirt2b">
    <summary class="mrshirt2a">A Fairly Small Front End Developer will be grateful for the Commision</summary>
     <br>
     I will be certainly be grateful to get a commission from a kind gentleman or lady, that showed interest in my works and services.
